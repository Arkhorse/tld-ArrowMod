# ArrowMod

This mod for *The Long Dark* allows you to adjust how arrows are crafted. Requires ModSettings.

## Features

1. Arrow craft time can be adjusted.
2. Arrowhead craft time can be adjusted. This also accurately adjusts the crafting time of the 7-arrowhead recipe in [ForgeBlueprintsMod](https://github.com/ds5678/ForgeBlueprintsMod).
3. Optionally, lines can be required for crafting arrows. However, it will not be visible in the crafting menu. This is caused by TLD and will probably not change.

## Installation

1. If you haven't done so already, install MelonLoader by downloading and running [MelonLoader.Installer.exe](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe)
